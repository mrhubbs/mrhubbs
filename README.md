When working, I always keep this in mind:

> A little thought goes a long way. A lot of thought goes a lot further.

I learned this the hard way early in my career. I believe that thinking ahead combined with adaptability, iterating under uncertainties, learning humbly and leveraging everyone's strengths is a sure-fire recipe for success.

I like meta thinking. This includes thinking about how we work (processes & methods) and creating software that is flexible, configurable, reusable and content-centric.
